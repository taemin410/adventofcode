## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, consisting of two parts. Participants solve these challenges using their programming skills, and it's a great way to learn new concepts and improve coding abilities.

## Languages Used

This year, I will be writing solutions in:

- Python
- C++

Each day's challenge will have its own directory containing:

- `solution.py` - Python solution for the challenge.
- `solution.cpp` - C++ solution for the challenge.
- `input.txt` - Input data used for testing the solution.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the Python solutions, make sure you have Python installed. You can execute the solution with the following command:

```bash
python day1/solution.py
```

```bash
g++ day1/solution.cpp -o day1/solution
./day1/solution
```
